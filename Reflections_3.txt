WHEN WOULD YOU WANT TO USE A REMOTE REPOSITORY RATHER THAN KEEPING ALL YOUR WORK LOCAL?

When there are multiple people working on the same file.

WHY MIGHT YOU WANT TO ALWAYS PULL CHANGES MANUALLY RATHER THAN HAVING GIT AUTOMATICALLY STAY UP-TO-DATE WITH YOUR REMOTE REPOSITORY?

There could be cases of rollbacks to previous versions before releasing the master branch to other users.


DESCRIBE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN FORKS, CLONES, AND BRANCHES. WHEN WOULD YOU USE ONE INSTEAD OF ANOTHER?

forks are used when you want to work on someone elses code but donot have access.
Also you can collaborate with other people on your forked repository and they can push their changes into the github repository directly.

Clone - Cloning is done when you want to make a local copy from the repository. 
Collaboration is not possible as you will be able to work on it alone.

Branch - This is created when you want to test some additional features but donot want to touch the working master version.
You can merge your changes later into the main version.
Collaboration is not possible.
